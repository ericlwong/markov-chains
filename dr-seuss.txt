Would you could you in a house?
Would you could you with a mouse?
Would you could you in a box?
Would you could you with a fox?
Would you like green eggs and ham?
Would you like them, Sam I am?
I will not let you fall.
I will hold you up high
As I stand on a ball.
With a book on one hand!
And a cup on my hat!
But that is not all I can do!
